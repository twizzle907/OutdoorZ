Vision Statement:
For anyone who is searching for adventure in an unfamiliar area or just bored with the status quo, the OutdoorZ application is an easy-to-use interactive web-based information system. OutdoorZ provides users with recommendations of nearby activities based on individual tastes. Users are able to provide valuable feedback and ratings while saving favorites to their profile. In addition, this app provides reliable directions to desired locations, as well as relevant feedback from real users. It utilizes publicly available data to provide the most accurate and up-to-date list of recreational activities so the user can spend their time making memories instead of plans. Unlike currently available applications, our product combines free and paid activities to provide the best possible experience to the user in an unbiased, ad-free format.

**Due to API constraints, API Key has been removed and app will not fully function without it!
